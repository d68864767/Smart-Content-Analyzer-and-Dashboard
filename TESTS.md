# Testing Guide for Smart Content Analyzer and Dashboard

This document provides a guide on how to test each service in the Smart Content Analyzer and Dashboard project.

## 1. Ingestion Service

To test the `IngestionService`, you can use the following commands:

```python
ingestion_service = IngestionService('your-bucket-name')

# Test upload
ingestion_service.upload_file('test.txt', 'test-upload.txt')

# Test list
ingestion_service.list_files()

# Test download
ingestion_service.download_file('test-upload.txt', 'test-download.txt')
```

Ensure that the file is uploaded, listed, and downloaded successfully.

## 2. Text Analysis Service

To test the `TextAnalysisService`, you can use the following commands:

```python
text_analysis_service = TextAnalysisService()

# Test sentiment analysis
response = text_analysis_service.analyze_sentiment('I am happy.')
print(response)

# Test entity analysis
response = text_analysis_service.analyze_entities('Google Cloud is a suite of cloud computing services.')
print(response)

# Test syntax analysis
response = text_analysis_service.analyze_syntax('This is a simple sentence.')
print(response)
```

Ensure that the sentiment, entity, and syntax analysis return the expected results.

## 3. Image Analysis Service

To test the `ImageAnalysisService`, you can use the following commands:

```python
image_analysis_service = ImageAnalysisService()

# Test image analysis
image_analysis_service.analyze_image('test.jpg')
```

Ensure that the image analysis returns the expected results.

## 4. Audio Analysis Service

To test the `AudioAnalysisService`, you can use the following commands:

```python
audio_analysis_service = AudioAnalysisService()

# Test audio transcription
transcriptions = audio_analysis_service.transcribe_audio('test.wav')
print(transcriptions)
```

Ensure that the audio transcription returns the expected results.

## 5. Data Storage Service

To test the `DataStorageService`, you can use the following commands:

```python
data_storage_service = DataStorageService('your-bucket-name', 'your-firestore-db')

# Test upload to bucket
data_storage_service.upload_to_bucket('test.txt', 'test-upload.txt')

# Test download from bucket
data_storage_service.download_from_bucket('test-upload.txt', 'test-download.txt')

# Test upload to Firestore
data_storage_service.upload_to_firestore('test-collection', 'test-document', {'field': 'value'})

# Test download from Firestore
data_storage_service.download_from_firestore('test-collection', 'test-document')
```

Ensure that the upload and download operations for both the bucket and Firestore work as expected.

## 6. Data Processing Service

To test the `DataProcessingService`, you can use the following commands:

```python
data_processing_service = DataProcessingService('your-bigquery-dataset')

# Test query execution
data_processing_service.execute_query('SELECT * FROM `your-bigquery-dataset.your-table`')
```

Ensure that the query execution returns the expected results.

## 7. Dashboard Service and User Authentication Service

To test the `DashboardService` and `UserAuthService`, you can use the following commands:

```javascript
// Test user registration
userAuthService.register('test@example.com', 'password')

// Test user login
userAuthService.login('test@example.com', 'password')

// Test dashboard data retrieval
dashboardService.getData()
```

Ensure that the user registration, login, and dashboard data retrieval work as expected.

## 8. Integration Tests

After testing each service individually, you should also perform integration tests to ensure that they work together as expected. This can involve creating a workflow that uses multiple services, such as ingesting content, analyzing it, storing the results, and displaying them on the dashboard.

Remember to also test the system with different types of content (text, images, audio) and different user roles (admin, viewer).
