# Smart Content Analyzer and Dashboard

This project is an AI-focused challenge that uses Google Cloud APIs to analyze various types of content (text, images, audio) and presents the analyzed data in a user-friendly dashboard.

## Overview

The system ingests content in various formats, such as text documents, images, and audio files. It uses Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyze text content for sentiment, entity recognition, and syntax analysis. Google Cloud Vision API is used to analyze images for object detection, label annotation, and optical character recognition (OCR). Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API is used to transcribe audio files and analyze the transcriptions. The processed data is stored in Google Cloud Storage or Cloud Firestore. A web-based dashboard is developed to display the analysis results. The dashboard is interactive and provides insights into the analyzed content.
